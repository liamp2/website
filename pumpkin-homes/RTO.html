                    <p class="text-justify">Welcome to Pumpkin Homes – where our focus is to help families like yours purchase a home, (or keep an existing home) when you are having difficulty securing a conventional mortgage from the banks. Our RENT to OWN (RTO) program provides more flexible financing options than the banks and allows you to choose your own house. We purchase it, you rent it, and then we transfer ownership to you in 2-4 years at a price that is guaranteed regardless of how much the real estate market goes up.  With our system you get to enjoy your home earlier and know that up to 20% of your monthly rent goes towards your final down payment. </p>
                    <p class="text-justify">Your family will benefit from a permanent location and will not have to deal with the upheaval (and expense) of moving regularly. If you have school-aged children you will appreciate being able to keep them in the same school, and with the same friends</p>

                                Your fixed monthly payment includes the following items: rent, property taxes, property insurance and a monthly down payment credit towards the final down payment. The monthly down payment credit is normally 20% of the total rent and is an amount always identified in the contract.

                                The amount saved for the final down payment is the sum total of the initial deposit plus all the monthly down payment credits.  The goal is to have 8-10% of the purchase price saved as a final down payment.  As an example:  if the initial purchase price was $270K then a 4% deposit would be about $11K,  the final guaranteed purchase price after 3 years would be about $300K.  The monthly savings towards your down payment credit would be  $444 per month x 36 months=$16K.   Thus your total savings towards the final down payment would be $27K ($11K + $16K) or about 9% of the final purchase price. We strongly encourage clients to accumulate a 10% down payment.

                                Yes. This is one of the many advantages of RTO program. You can paint, install laminate flooring, landscape, build a deck, install a jungle gym in the backyard and treat the house like your own. Any large or structural changes we will want to review and approve, but as long as it increases the overall value and appeal of the home, you will get the green light.  If a building permit is required this will be your responsibility.

The RTO program can be used to help you stay in your existing home, your existing neighbourhood, and keep your kids at the same school. The same process for qualification and approval will apply. We agree on a current purchase price and then confirm the value with a home appraisal.   When closing the purchase we provide your lawyer with 93-95% of the agreed price to pay off your existing mortgage and debts.  The remaining 5-7% is treated as an initial deposit for the final down payment.  We have helped several families with our Home Refinance Option and keep their homes.

                                We prefer to meet all clients personally and remain involved during the rental period. We therefore prefer to help families in the communities near our home in Aurora. We are also better equipped to lend real estate experience in a market that is familiar to us.

                                We strongly believe the areas north of the GTA, from Newmarket and Bradford through to Barrie will continue to experience strong population growth, strong local economic growth, and also provide easy commuting distance to other employment areas in the GTA by car or the Go train.  These demographic and economic factors have historically led to strong increases in home prices.  These geographic areas still offer affordable housing prices today, and due to the reasons above should continue to experience positive increases in home prices in the future.  Barrie specifically has been identified as one of the Top 10 Canadian cities for real estate investment for several years by REIN (Real Estate Investment Network).
