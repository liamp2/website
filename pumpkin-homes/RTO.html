                    <h2>Rent-to-Own Program</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Welcome to Pumpkin Homes – where our focus is to help families like yours purchase a home, (or keep an existing home) when you are having difficulty securing a conventional mortgage from the banks. Our RENT to OWN (RTO) program provides more flexible financing options than the banks and allows you to choose your own house. We purchase it, you rent it, and then we transfer ownership to you in 2-4 years at a price that is guaranteed regardless of how much the real estate market goes up.  With our system you get to enjoy your home earlier and know that up to 20% of your monthly rent goes towards your final down payment. </p>
                    <p>Your family will benefit from a permanent location and will not have to deal with the upheaval (and expense) of moving regularly. If you have school-aged children you will appreciate being able to keep them in the same school, and with the same friends</p>

Analyzing your financial information to ensure you would qualify at the end of term is crucial.  After verifying your employment, income and personal information we will approve you for our RTO program. There will be a non- refundable deposit of $500 at this stage to show your commitment, and to cover our costs of reserving the financing.</p>
